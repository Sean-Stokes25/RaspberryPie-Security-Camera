<h1>This is a 5th year Alt4 project</h1>

It took me about 2 weeks to complete
I used a RaspberryPie,The PiCamera and a PIR motion sensor

When the PIR sensor detects motion the PiCamera begins recording (as a .h264 file) once the motion has stopped an email is sent to 
the reciever with the time motion was detected and the video clip captured from the PiCamera

Note:To open .h264 files you may need to install a media player such as VLC
